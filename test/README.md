# Tests

These tests use the source code of this repo.

Therefore the paths are `"eip_scanner/..."` rather than `<eip_scanner/...>`
* The source files are being linked directly rather than through the eip_scanner `/usr/local/lib` shared object file 


## Requirements

The GMock Library: `sudo apt install libgmock-dev`
