## Contribution

We welcome outside contributions for any improvements, features, or new devices (see below) to the library. Please create a pull request with unit/mock tests

## Vendor specific objects & devices

Our goal is to maintain an active device catalog of all EtherNet/IP devices and their objects that we encounter. We encourage others to contribute to this communal device catalog in /src/vendor/.

All vendor source files are automatically enabled. If you'd like to disable vendor files, you can disable with any of the below options.
1) set this option in CMakeLists.txt
```cmake
option(ENABLE_VENDOR_SRC "Enable vendor source" OFF)
```
2) set the cmake build flag 
```shell
-DENABLE_VENDOR_SRC=OFF
```
3) manually comment needed files in src/vendor/CMakeLists.txt
